THE HEIST

Basic gambling card game made for MDM4U1 (Data Management)

The player pays $30 to draw 5 cards from a deck ranging from 1-12 and a bomb card. 
Cards are replaced after being drawn and are added to the total payout. 
After each turn, the lowest value card from the deck is removed. 
Drawing a bomb card results in a $0 payout for the round. 

General Remarks:
  The heist is an exciting game that on average results in a 23% loss for the player and a 30% profit for the house. 
  It is geometrically distributed, and while the outcomes mostly follow a bell curve, the added conditional probability of drawing a bomb skews the probabilities to produce lower average payouts. 
  There is a higher probability to win money than to lose money, but the existence of the bomb card causes the average amount lost to be much higher than the average amount gained. 
  Additionally, it has a high standard deviation, meaning that there is a large spread and the player could likely have extreme and difficult to predict results if they play very few times. 
  Altogether, the heist is a unique gambling card game that provides a sense of victory, while also presenting an element of risk and randomness.
